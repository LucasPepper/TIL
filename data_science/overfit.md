## Overfitting

The model fitted too much to the dataset, not necessarily learning the existing correlations between the independent and dependent variables.

It's like to say that it memorized the dataset (too much studying).

The problem will be at the time of dealing with new data: as the model didn't learn the relations, it won't be able to predict the data with precision in another dataset.
