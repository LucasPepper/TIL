## Usage

After creating a new entry, run `./createReadme.py > README.md` to regenerate
the readme with the new data.

If you are using git, you can install this script as a pre-commit git hook so
that it is autogenerated on each commit.  Use the following command:
    cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../createReadme.py pre-commit && cd -


## About
